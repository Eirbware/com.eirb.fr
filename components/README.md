# Svelte + TS + Vite as Components for Flask jinja pages

That's a lot of stack for such a small project, isn't it?

Actually, that is not.

- Svelte makes the frontend application easier to be divided into modular components, and it makes it more scalable if features have to be updated, added or remove.
- Typescript just statically strengthen the application correctness.
- Vite is embedded with Flask to support both a friendly development and production modes for the developers.
